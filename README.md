## Background
The House of Commons in the UK held a series of indicative votes on Britain's withdrawal from the EU (Brexit) on March 27th and April 1st, 2019. A dataset giving the votes is available as open source data. Within the dataset, a matrix called \divisions" gives the outcome of the votes and a vector called \labels" gives the name of each vote.  The vote outcomes are recorded as \aye vote", \nay vote" and absent.1 

## Objectives
Finite mixture models were used to investigate the following whether the House of Commons politicians fall into clusters when voting on Brexit, and wheter the politicians in each cluster tend to have similar voting behaviour
